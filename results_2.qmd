# Plots combining all PN and N overall

These plots show the percentage of each pitch accent by city in nuclear or prenuclear positions in broad and narrow focus declarative statement.

Each comparison was a poisson regression testing whether the count of a given pitch accent different as a function of city for each position (nuclear or prenuclear) and statement type (broad or narrow focus).

Example for in line reporting, looking at the first plot:

> In prenuclear broad focus declaratives, Montevideo speakers were predicted to produce H\* significantly more than Durazno speakers (p \< .05).

Recall the the number of asterisks is the number of 0's when you report:

NS \<- p \> .05

\* \<- p \< .05

\*\* \<- p \< .005

\*\*\* \<- p \< .005

# UPDATES

Here are some of the new requested plot series, in addition to the fixed plots above. We have differences by sex, education and age. Not a lot of significant findings returned for education and age, but I think this is a sampling issue (more people might have turned out a difference in a given comparison). For time's sake and to get this to you sooner, I am leaving the explanation to a minumum in case these need to be majorly edited. Each series of plots has 8 total, four for each city, with two narrow focus and two broad focus, and those being subdivided into focused/unfocused (for NFD) and nuclear or prenuclear (BFD).

## Post 4/2 Email:

I am quoting your email here for convenience:

> 1.  One graph total, containing NFD 1-6 Focused on the x axis (not the word, just NFD #), count or percentage on the y and colors for pitch accent with boundary tone type as one (show first with all the possible options, then a second plot removing token options with a count less than 5. (separate graphs for each city). If what I said makes sense this should render 4 graphs total and compare the focalized cell of each NFD (with the x-axis labeled e.g., NFD1 not Naranajas.) and above each likely more than one vertical bar (but not a ton) one bar for each pitch accent + Boundary tone% as one in that position color coded to a legend.

### First 4

**Montevideo Focused NFD**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sentence, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2")
```

**Montevideo Focused NFD trimmed - 3 or greater**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sentence, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2")
```

**Durazno Focused NFD trimmed - 3 or greater**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Durazno") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sentence, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2")
```

**Durazno Focused NFD trimmed - 3 or greater**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Durazno") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sentence, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2")
```

> Afterwards and if possible those same 4 graphs but with a double x axis where the category is still NFD1 through NFD6 but then divides the tokens of the NFD1 though NFD6 into two sets of bars above it, one set for males and another for females. (If too many bars with all Pitch accent types then reduce by excluding uncommon pitch accent types) 2-4 graphs depending on reduction or no If this is possible then do the graph again by age group instead of sex (for both of these multiple bar sets only displaying tokens with over 5 occurrences may be needed.) 2-4 graphs.

The double x axis is not really possible (to my knowledge) in ggplot, but we can facet, as I've done below:

## Plots by sex

**Montevideo Focused NFD by sex**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, SEX) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

**Montevideo Focused NFD by sex trimmed**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, SEX) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

  filter(n >= 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, Age.Group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age.Group, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Montevideo") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, Age.Group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age.Group, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

**Durazno Focused NFD by age group**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Durazno") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, Age.Group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age.Group, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

**Durazno Focused NFD by age group - trimmed**

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(DEPT == "Durazno") %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "NFD") %>% 
  filter(focused == 1) %>% 
  group_by(sentence, tones, Age.Group) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 3) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age.Group, y = n, fill = tones)) + geom_col(position = "dodge2") +
  facet_wrap(~sentence)
```

> In these graphs from 2 and 3 above, signal if possible if there is statistical significance within the females/age groups choice of X pitch accent+boundary tone for each category (NFD1-6) as well as testing significance for the same pitch accent between men and women of the same category. If this made since we might see for NFD1 that females have two main options L+H\* L% or L+H\*+L L% and I want to know if the women used one significantly more than the other for NFD1 in particular. Then we will have bars representing the males' options of the same pitch accents and the same analysis as for the women, but additionally I would also like to know if between men and women for the same pitch accent combination in the same category if there is a significant difference. (NFD1 \> Female L+H\* L% vs NFD1 \> Male L+H\* L%) If that doesn't make sense please let me know before you spend time trying my make it. I am drawn and attached pictures with made up information. (This is me trying to be clear not insulting) I am a pictures guy.

No worries! The pictures are helpful. Let's wait for the tests, since they take the most time, but making plots are pretty straight forward. Looking at just these plots, just so you're aware, we are looking at almost 200 total comparisons, so integrating this into the visualizations is what takes the most time. What do you say: let's nail down the figures first and add the needed tests (whether or not it's all possible combinations) once the visuals are done.
