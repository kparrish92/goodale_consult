# Plots combining all PN and N overall

These plots show the percentage of each pitch accent by city in nuclear or prenuclear positions in broad and narrow focus declarative statement.

Each comparison was a poisson regression testing whether the count of a given pitch accent different as a function of city for each position (nuclear or prenuclear) and statement type (broad or narrow focus).

Example for in line reporting, looking at the first plot:

> In prenuclear broad focus declaratives, Montevideo speakers were predicted to produce H\* significantly more than Durazno speakers (p \< .05).

Recall the the number of asterisks is the number of 0's when you report:

NS \<- p \> .05

\* \<- p \< .05

\*\* \<- p \< .005

\*\*\* \<- p \< .005

# UPDATES

Here are some of the new requested plot series, in addition to the fixed plots above. We have differences by sex, education and age. Not a lot of significant findings returned for education and age, but I think this is a sampling issue (more people might have turned out a difference in a given comparison). For time's sake and to get this to you sooner, I am leaving the explanation to a minumum in case these need to be majorly edited. Each series of plots has 8 total, four for each city, with two narrow focus and two broad focus, and those being subdivided into focused/unfocused (for NFD) and nuclear or prenuclear (BFD).
