### Montevideo BFD/non-focalized graphs:

**Graph 1: Montevideo BFD nuclear configurations (i.e., pitch accent + boundary tone) (not by gender or age).**

```{r} 
mv_long %>% 
  filter(sentence_type == "BFD" & position_spec == "N") %>%  
  group_by(tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tones, y = n, position = "dodge")) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge2") + goodale_theme() 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
mod1 = mv_long %>%  # Tidy the data for the model and only include levels with 5+ observations
  filter(sentence_type == "BFD" & position_spec == "N") %>%  
  group_by(tones, DEPT) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())  %>% 
  filter(n > 5)

mod_1 = glm(n ~ tones, data = mod1, family = poisson(link = "log")) # run the model
mod_report_object = summary(mod_1)[["coefficients"]] # create an object for easier reporting
mod_diff = round(mod_report_object[2,1], digits = 2) # extract the estimate from the model
```

> Graph 1: A poisson regression was run where the dependent variable was n (number of occurrences) and the independent variable was tone (only the tones L\*L% and L+H\*L& were included).
The model revealed a significant difference between these two levels (β = `r mod_diff`; p < .05).

**Graph 2: Montevideo BFD nuclear configurations (i.e., pitch accent + boundary tone) (not by gender or age).**

```{r}
mv_long %>% 
  filter(is.na(focused) & position_spec != "N") %>%  
  group_by(tones, DEPT) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(tones, '-')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tones, y = n, position = "dodge")) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge2") + goodale_theme() 
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
mod_2 = mv_long %>% 
  filter(is.na(focused) & position_spec != "N") %>%  
  group_by(tones, DEPT) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(tones, '-')) %>% 
  filter(n > 35)


mod2 = glm(n ~ tones, data = mod_2, family = poisson(link = "log")) # run the model

mod_df = summary(mod2)[["coefficients"]] %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
    mutate(across(everything(), ~ round(., 2))) %>% 
  rename(`p value` = `Pr(>|z|)`)

mod_df$`p value` = as.character(mod_df$`p value`)


mod_df$`p value` = gsub("^0$", "<b>< .005*</b>", mod_df$`p value`)

```

> Graph 2: A poisson regression was run where the dependent variable was n (number of occurrences) and the independent variable was tone (6 levels for this model: H\*, H+L\*, L+¡H\*, L+<H\*, L+H\* and deaccented(DA)).
The intercept of the model is DA, so the differences which are significant (L+<H\* and L+¡H\*) only tell us that these two pitch accents are predicted by the model to be produced significantly more than deaccented tokens.
The do not tell us about all possible comparisons, and we would need to do post-hoc tests for this. 
It would be best to do post-hoc tests only as needed, or re-level to models to change the reference if you want a particular tone to be the baseline that the other tones are compared to.

```{r}
plot_sex_per_city("Montevideo", "BFD", "N") + goodale_theme()

  group_by(tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tones, y = n, position = "dodge")) +

mod1_d$tones <- replace(mod1_d$tones,is.na(mod1_d$tones),"N/A")

mod_diff_d = round(mod_report_object_d[2,1], digits = 2) # extract the estimate from the model
mod_diff_na = round(mod_report_object_d[3,1], digits = 2) # extract the estimate from 
```
> Graph 14: A poisson regression was run where the dependent variable was n (number of occurrences) and the independent variable was tone (the tones L\*L% and L+H\*L% and N/A were included).
The model revealed a significant difference between L\*L% and L+H\*L% two levels (β = `r mod_diff_d`; p < .05). and between L\*L% and N/A `r mod_diff_na`.

**Graph 15: Durazno BFD nuclear configurations (i.e., pitch accent + boundary tone) (not by gender or age).**

```{r}
dz_long %>%

  group_by(tones, DEPT) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(tones, '-')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tones, y = n, position = "dodge")) +

```

> Graph 15: A poisson regression was run where the dependent variable was n (number of occurrences) and the independent variable was tone (3 levels for this model: L\*+H, L+<H\* and L+H\*).
The intercept of the model is L\*+H, so, like the model for Montevideo, all differences which are significant only tell us that these two pitch accents are predicted by the model to be produced significantly more than  L\*+H tokens.

```{r}
long_all %>% 
  filter(focused == 0 & position_spec != "N") %>%  
  group_by(tones, DEPT) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(tones, '-')) %>%

**NFD1 (Render each graph in such a way that I can present the three graphs side by side) At this point combining the two may no longer be worth it. I may just have to compare the two individual graphs, do you agree?**


> This is totally up to you. If you feel you have the time and space, we can make graphs like one below this message. This kind of plot gets to be pretty busy, given that there's a lot going on on the x axis, so I don't know if it's worth it. If you want, though, we can trim to a minumum number of observations by one or both groups and run poisson regressions on all comparisons. This would take me ~1 hour. However, doing this for NFD1 means I can instantly do the same for all other sentences. 

**Graph 30: NFD1 by city**

```{r}
df_p7 = long_all %>% 
  filter(sentence == "NFD1") %>% 
  group_by(DEPT, tones) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) 

df_p7 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tones, y = n, position = "dodge", fill = DEPT)) + 
  geom_col(color = "black", position = "dodge2") + goodale_theme() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(1,max(df_p7$n),1)) +
